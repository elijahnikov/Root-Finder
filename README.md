# Root-Finder
A Java program to find the root of a specific function through the use of user selected root finding algorithms: Newton-Raphson, Bisection, Secant, False Position.

Coursework project for my Computer Algorithms and Modelling module at university.
Created to learn advanced data structures such as linked lists and stacks.

>Uses JFreeChart to display root finding results on a graph: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jfree/jfreechart/
