# Root-Finder
A Java program to find the root of a specific function through the use of user selected root finding algorithms: Newton-Raphson, Bisection, Secant, False Position.

Coursework project for my Computer Algorithms and Modelling module at university.
Created to learn advanced data structures such as linked lists and stacks.

Uses JFreeChart to display root finding results on a graph: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jfree/jfreechart/
